# PacMen (multiple) Exercise
<a href="https://jefejuell.github.io/PacMen"> PacMen Exercise </a>

### **Description:**  
PacMen should create additonal PacMen when pressing the Add PacMan button.  Upon clicking the Start Game button, the Pacmen will move in random directions at random velocities until they detect a boundary of the webpage, at which point they will bounce off the edge.  Challenge: Try to get the PacMen to move faster.  Of course, motion requires energy, so the PacMen will be eating invisible food as they travel around. 

### **Usage**
To view PacMen, download all files into a folder and drag the index.html into a web browser. Alternatively, you can click on the link above or go to https://jefejuell.github.io/PacMen 

### **Roadmap of future improvements**
Additional features will be to modify the Start Game button so that it doesn't also act as an accelerator.  It will also be important to get the PacMen able to move normally if the viewing screen is resized (currently some can get stuck near the edges).
